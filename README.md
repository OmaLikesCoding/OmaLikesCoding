Hi, I'm Oma. I am a software engineer with experience in entrepreneurship, coaching, data analytics, problem solving, and marketing. As a person I am an outgoing, collaborative, energetic individual who  enjoys a good laugh or two.

Way way back in time I started my coding in the days of old... The same way that a lot of millennials did... MySpace (Insert giggle here). As a teen I thought it was so cool to add effects, music, and photos on a platform that truly allowed you to show the world your personality and personify it through technology. This shifted my childhood passion from fine art to digital and graphic design. I utilized this passion and allowed it to help me build a strong digital presence for my brand The Hair Chest HRC. 

My work experience includes high volume sales, customer service, management, recruiting, branding, e-mail/social media/grassroots marketing, and banking. After working in these fields I was able to identify an opportunity for end users to get better usage of the digital products we've come to enjoy in this day and age. I also enjoy updating and debugging too. At the core of who I am there is a problem solver that loves to bring ease of use and joy to stakeholders and the end users who will drive the growth and usage of the many things we create as developers/engineers.
