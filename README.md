Hi, I'm Oma. I am a software & data engineer with experience in entrepreneurship, banking, data analytics, retail, and marketing. As a person I am an outgoing, collaborative, energetic individual who  enjoys a good laugh or two.

Throughout my journey, I delved into coding during the MySpace era, a familiar path for many millennials (Insert giggle here). The platform's creative features sparked my fascination with digital and graphic design, shifting my childhood passion from fine art. Leveraging this passion, I built a strong digital presence for my brand, The Hair Chest HRC.

My diverse work experience encompasses high-volume sales, customer service, management, recruiting, branding, and various marketing strategies, including e-mail, social media, and grassroots marketing. Through these roles, I recognized an opportunity to enhance the end-user experience and optimize digital products. My penchant for updating and debugging further strengthens my problem-solving abilities.

At the core of my being lies a problem solver who thrives on bringing ease of use and joy to stakeholders and end users alike. I am driven to contribute to the growth and success of our creations as a product manager, enriching the lives of those who interact with our innovative developments as developers and engineers.
